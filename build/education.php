                <h3>Initial digital signage aims:</h3>

                <ul>
                	<li>Create high-quality media that is in accordance with the school’s mission statement&nbsp;</li>
                	<li>Find a multi-use, affordable and flexible application to fulfil the school’s digital signage aims</li>
                	<li>Begin using the digital signage framework already in place to inform, update and educate students and staff members</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Digital signage hardware used</h3>

                <p>Both screens are Samsung HDTV’s. One screen is connected to a Windows 7-based computer (Intel NUC), and the other utilizes a Google Chromebit.</p>

                <h3>Digital signage software used</h3>

                <p>After shopping around for about a month or two, it became very clear that there was no way we could afford the “bigger names” in digital signage out there. We signed up for a few trial accounts, but nothing was very user-friendly. On many websites, it was unclear what application/program was being offered, the price of the digital signage, or if there was a trial account I could access right away. If anything, most sites pointed me to sales reps. As a very busy educator, I don’t have the luxury or the inclination to sit around and wait on a sales rep to get back to me, to schedule a video conference with one, and so on.</p>

                <p>Until we stumbled upon ScreenCloud! And I’m so glad.</p>

                <p>At first, I thought, compared to other examples I’ve seen, that ScreenCloud was just a ‘glorified slideshow’ provider. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Google Slides, in particular, has been a lifesaver. It allows my entire media team to share their work with one another on Google’s platform, to collaborate, and make immediate changes to our content (announcements, reminders, photo galleries, etc.). Updating our digital signage using Google Slides couldn’t be any simpler.</p>

                <p>I’m also able to share Google documents with students without having to give them access to our ScreenCloud account.</p>

                <h3>Content creation</h3>

                <p>We create all of our material in-house, using PhotoShop, Google Slides, and various graphic and typography apps found on Apple’s App Store.</p>

                <p>It’s been a terrific way for my media students to learn graphic design skills and then be able to show off their handiwork in real-time. Their assignments are for the “real world,” and I’ve enjoyed seeing each student take careful, diligent ownership of our screens on campus.</p>

                <h3>What we’re saying about ScreenCloud</h3>

                <p>ScreenCloud, though ‘across the pond’ from us, has been very prompt and professional in every communication we’ve had. Everyone I’ve been in contact with, from the CEO to the support staff, has only validated that we made the right choice to go with ScreenCloud as our school’s digital signage solution.</p>

                <p>As a small school, we appreciate the educational pricing offered.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>ScreenCloud is the best decision we’ve made. It’s been the ultimate affordable, attractive solution to digital signage.</p>

                <p>Our campus was recently renovated, and adding digital signage via ScreenCloud has just taken our campus to the next level in terms of aesthetics, communication, and professionalism.</p>

                <p>We already had everything in place - flatscreens and a fast, reliable Internet connection - but it took ScreenCloud to put it all together for us!</p>
